# QUANTUM MONTE CARLO Project

The ```code.F90``` is a program to compute energies over simple hydrogen or helium based system using Monte Carlo algorithm. In particular in the program are implemented the Variational Monte Carlo and the Pure Diffusion Monte Carlo algorithms.
The code is able to compute the energy only for system made by hydrogen and Helium with at least 2 electrons such as H, He, H<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, H<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>.
For more details please check the ```Document``` file.

## Download and installation
To get a copy of the program you can clone the repository from <https://github.com/upellix/montecarlo_project.git> directly in your computer or download the ```.zip``` file from GitHub.
The program is written in Fortran 90 so you need a fortran compiler (*gfortran*, *pgfortran*, *ifort*, ...) to compile the code.

## Run the program
